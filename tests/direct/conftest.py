# -- Windows compatibility shim for genlayer-test 0.29.2 ----------------------
#
# The official direct runner injects the transaction message by writing it to
# a temp file, dup2-ing that file onto fd 0 and unlinking the path while fd 0
# still references it. POSIX permits that; Windows refuses with WinError 32,
# so every direct test errors at deploy on a fresh Windows checkout. The shim
# tolerates that one refusal and changes nothing else. It is a no-op on Linux
# and macOS, so CI runs the runner as published.
